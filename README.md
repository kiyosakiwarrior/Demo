Tomorrow I will embark on a journey to the middle of America. It's a metropolitan hub of America's deep seeded bustling city culture. I hope to gain some sort of semblance from my stay there. I want to adjust who I am based on the knowledge I gain from observing my surroundings. I want to see the type of American life that goes on there. How they celebrate Christmas, what they do on Sunday's. Just the general theme of how they live.
